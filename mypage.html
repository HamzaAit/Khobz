      <p>I am 16 years old from Temara. How beautiful is programming, it's like acold wind that blows in your face when
 it's extremely hot, Like the sweet taste of chicken after weeks and weeks of hunger. The feeling of satisfaction when you
 realise that your code, your own creation, is just an overwhelming feeling of happiness, you feel proud and glad!
 Ever since my first line of code: print("Hello World!"), I fell in love with this science, that's sadly not given the importance
 it deserves in our education system. All those who, just like me, had the same passion for programming, were lost in the dark,
 not knowing a=what the next is to follow their dreams and hopes, and pursue what they love and enjoy, rather than what society
 made typical, and the E-nitiate camp is the torch in the dark, that will help us, and guide us, and show us the path that we've
 been desperately looking for. It just seemed too good to be true, and it soon became my biggest objective for the summer, I took
 it really seriouly, and I did my best at the application process, and I fortunately got in! i'm currently witnessing the first
 days of the camp, and I can honestly tell you it's better than what I expected, and believe me when I say that my expectations
 were as high as the glowing stars in the black sky of a dark night, and it still exceeded them! The professors are amazingly
 nice and smart, you couldn't find better. And the variety of the activities available is just unbelievable. In E-nitiate, you 
 learn what you're pationate about, while having a lot of fun! This is just amazing, and I dam not looking forward to say good-bye.
